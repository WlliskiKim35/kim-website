    <h2>A Little About Me<h2/>
<p>My name is Kim, and I’m from Grenada, Mississippi, where I was born and raised. I’m 35 years old, and my birthday is January 5, 1990.</p>
<p>I currently work as a Learning Trainer at Amazon. I’ve been with the company for five years, and I love helping new hires get started on the right foot. I’m also pursuing a degree in Web Application Development at CSU Global, where I'm earning a certificate in website design and development. One of my biggest dreams is to own a business creating custom websites for entrepreneurs.</p>
