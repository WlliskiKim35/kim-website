     <h2>Music That Inspires Me</h2>
        <p>
      Music has always played a big part in my life. Whether I’m relaxing after work, getting motivated during the day, or simply enjoying a moment of peace, there’s always a song that fits the mood.
      I enjoy a wide range of music, from R&B and gospel to hip-hop and soul. Artists like Rihanna, SZA, Kirk Franklin, and Keisha Cole are some of my favorites. Their music lifts me up, energizes me, and reminds me to stay grounded.
