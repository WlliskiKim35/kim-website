    <h1>Professional Growth</h1>
    <p>I started at Amazon as a Tier 1 associate...</p>
<p>I'm currently working as a Learning Trainer. I’ve been with the company for five years, and I love helping new hires get started on the right foot. I’m also pursuing a degree in Web Application Development at CSU Global, where I'm earning a certificate in website design and development. One of my biggest dreams is to own a business creating custom websites for entrepreneurs.</p>
