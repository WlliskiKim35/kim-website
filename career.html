    <h1>Career Goals</h1>
<p>I started at Amazon as a Tier 1 associate at MEM1, worked my way to a Problem Solver, then became a Non-Inventory Receiver at Tier 3. Today, Iâ€™m proud to be a Learning Trainer at BNA6. My journey reflects my commitment to growth and leadership.</p>
<p>In the near future, I aim to launch a business that offers personalized websites for new small business owners, especially those who are just getting started and need help building their online presence.</p>
