    <h1>Professional Growth</h1>
    <p>I started at Amazon as a Tier 1 associate...</p>
<p>I currently serve as a Learning Trainer, a role I’ve proudly held for five years. I genuinely enjoy guiding new hires and helping them start their journey with confidence and support. In addition to my career, I’m pursuing a degree in Web Application Development at CSU Global, where I’m earning a certificate in website design and development. My long-term goal is to launch my own business that specializes in creating custom websites for entrepreneurs, helping them build a strong online presence from the ground up.</p>
