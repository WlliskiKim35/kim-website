    <h2>What I Love Doing in My Free Time</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m not working or studying, I like to unwind and enjoy some of the simple things in life. One of my favorite ways to relax is by listening to music or watching short, funny videos online. They keep me entertained and brighten my day.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also enjoy baking – especially desserts! Trying out new recipes and sharing treats with family and friends brings me a lot of joy. Baking allows me to be creative and patient at the same time.
